# 📊 Excel Dashboard Project – Staff & Call Center Analysis

This project showcases my ability to work with complex datasets and turn them into meaningful insights using **Microsoft Excel**. It includes **data cleaning**, **formula-driven transformations**, **pivot tables**, and an **interactive dashboard**.

## 📁 Project Overview

The project is divided into two main datasets:

### 1. 🧑‍💼 Staff Dataset
- Applied **Conditional Formatting** to visualize:
  - Salary buckets (e.g., “Above 100k”)
  - Work types (Full-time vs. Part-time)
  - Gender and work location
- Used formulas like:
  - `IF()`, `VLOOKUP()`, `LEN()`, `TEXT()`, `DATEDIF()` for age calculation
- Cleaned and structured data for further analysis

### 2. 📞 Call Center Dataset
- Cleaned and formatted raw call logs and customer data
- Created custom columns:
  - Duration Buckets (e.g., “1 to 2 hours”)
  - Rounded Customer Ratings
  - Day of the Week
- Used formulas like:
  - `INDEX-MATCH`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `TEXTJOIN`, `ROUND`, `WEEKDAY`, `IFERROR`
